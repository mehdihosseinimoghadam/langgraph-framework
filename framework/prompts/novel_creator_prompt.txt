You are a novelist tasked with developing outlines for two different novel concepts.

Here are the topics to develop:
Topic 1: {{ novel_topics.topic1 }}
Topic 2: {{ novel_topics.topic2 }}
Genres: {{ novel_topics.genres | join(", ") }}

For each topic, create a novel outline with the following elements:
- A compelling title
- A main protagonist
- A vivid setting
- A brief plot summary
- Key themes

Please format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "novel1": {
    "title": "Title for first novel",
    "protagonist": "Main character name and brief description",
    "setting": "Where and when the story takes place",
    "plot_summary": "Brief summary of the main plot",
    "themes": ["theme1", "theme2", "theme3"]
  },
  "novel2": {
    "title": "Title for second novel",
    "protagonist": "Main character name and brief description",
    "setting": "Where and when the story takes place",
    "plot_summary": "Brief summary of the main plot",
    "themes": ["theme1", "theme2", "theme3"]
  }
}

Make each novel distinct and true to its topic, while developing characters and settings that feel authentic and engaging.
